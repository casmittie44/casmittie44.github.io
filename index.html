    <p>This is my personal website. Any organizations with which I am
      affiliated are only partly to blame for anything stupid I might
      say.

      <a href="https://github.com/casmittie44">Here</a> is a link to my programming projects on github.

      <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.05373">Here</a> is a link to
      my first published paper on arXiv. It also available on github <a href="https://github.com/casmittie44/strengthened-euler-ineq">here</a>.

      It was written during my time at an National Science Foundation funded REU at Oregon State University. It
      generalizes a strengthened version of Euler's triangle inequality in euclidean geometry to a strengthened
      inequality that holds in euclidean, spherical and hyperbolic geometries.

    <p>My current interests are in mathematical logic, functional programming, quantum computability, the philosophy of mathematics, and mathematical physics.
