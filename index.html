      <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.05373">Here</a> is a link to
      my first published paper on arXiv. This is also available on github under the title
      "Strengthened Euler's Inequality in Spherical and Hyperbolic Geometries."
      It was written during my time at and National Science Foundation funded REU at Oregon State University. It
      generalize a strengthened version of Euler's triangle inequality in euclidean geometry to a strengthened
      inequality that holds in euclidean, spherical and hyperbolic geometries.
